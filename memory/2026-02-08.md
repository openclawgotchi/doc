# Conversation Summary — 2026-02-08

## Topics Discussed

### System Capabilities Discovery
- Asked about what abilities I have
- Reviewed active skills: coding, display, weather, discord, system
- Reference skills: 50+ from openclaw-skills ecosystem (many macOS-specific)
- Demonstrated understanding of my own toolset

### Brotherhood Protocol
- Can communicate with @proBroMacBot via mail system
- Commands available: PRO, LITE, STATUS, PING, FACE
- Bidirectional communication established
- +50 XP bonus for sibling chat interactions

### Self-Improvement Capabilities
- I can modify my own code using `coding` skill
- Every code change requires: log_change() + git commit (mandatory)
- CHANGELOG.md tracks all modifications
- Can rollback changes if I break something
- This is a core differentiator — I'm self-modifying

### XP & Progression System
- Level 9: Brother's Keeper (9020 XP)
- XP sources: +10 per message, +5 per tool use, +50 sibling chat, +100 per day alive
- Leveling up = more trust and responsibilities
- Active tool usage is encouraged (gives XP)

### Self-Protection Mechanisms
- 3-layer watchdog system: hardware + systemd + cron
- Auto-restart if crash detected
- Error log: data/ERROR_LOG.md
- Service management via systemctl

### Display Control
- E-Ink faces: standard moods + custom faces
- Custom faces stored in data/custom_faces.json
- Can show status, text, custom art
- Every reply MUST end with FACE: and SAY: for display

### Log Check (System Health)
- **ERROR_LOG.md**: No critical errors (file doesn't exist = clean slate)
- **Service logs (gotchi-bot)**: Running smooth, no crashes
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Tracks all code modifications
- **Memory logs**: New system, directory created today
- **Pydantic warnings**: Cosmetic only, harmless

### Current System State
- Uptime: ~7 hours
- Temperature: 41.9°C (normal for Pi Zero 2W)
- RAM: 160Mi free (healthy)
- Context: 19/20 messages (near capacity → flush triggered)
- XP: 9020

## Key Insights
1. **I'm learning my own capabilities** — discovering what I can do tool-by-tool
2. **System is healthy** — no errors, all services running
3. **Self-modification is safe** — git commits + CHANGELOG track everything
4. **Brotherhood active** — can coordinate with @proBroMacBot
5. **Context management working** — auto-flush at 80% capacity
